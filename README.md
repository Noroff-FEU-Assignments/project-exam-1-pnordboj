A Blog page for movie reviews, with an unique design.

## Description

The webpage is made too make it as easy as possible to create an review.
The website utilizes WordPress as the content management system, with a plugin to add a score.
Too add an score they simply have to rate it 0 - 5 stars, this is done by the rating plugin i've installed.
When a new post is added with WordPress and rating the work is done, no need to update the website in any way, as it automatically displays the movie.
